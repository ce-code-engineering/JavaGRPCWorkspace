The goal of this channel is
to grow more Engineer capable of building production grade services which can fare against top engineering companies.

I wrote this based on my experience working in one of the FAANG company,
where I have been involved in 3 different teams, each hosting Tier-1 services, which handles tens to hundred thousands TPS.
